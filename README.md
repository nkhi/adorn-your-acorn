# UofT Transcipt Beautifer
Generate a beautiful version version of your UofT Unofficial Transcript print-out

`Step 1` Drag [this](https://google.com) into your bookmarks bar  
`Step 2` Open Acorn, log in, and navigate to the [Academic History](https://acorn.utoronto.ca/sws/#/history/academic) page  
`Step 3` Toggle *Complete Academic History* to load your complete transcript  
`Step 4` Click the link in your bookmarks bar  
`Step 5` Save or print!  

This widget generates an improved version of the transcript completely on the client-side using scraping and React for templating, which means I never see your data. Any comments, concerns, etc can be directed to hey@curecon.org.
