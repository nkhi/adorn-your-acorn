# UofT Transcipt Beautifer
Generate a beautiful version version of your UofT Unofficial Transcript print-out

**Step 1:** Drag [this](https://google.com) into your bookmarks bar  
**Step 2:** Open Acorn, log in, and navigate to the [Academic History](https://acorn.utoronto.ca/sws/#/history/academic) page  
**Step 3:** Toggle *Complete Academic History* to load your complete transcript  
**Step 4:** Click the `🐿️🐿️🐿️` link in your bookmarks bar  
**Step 5:** Save or print!  

This widget generates an improved version of the transcript completely on the client-side using scraping and React for templating, which means I never see your data. I'm reachable by email at [hey@curecon.org](mailto:hey@curecon.org).
